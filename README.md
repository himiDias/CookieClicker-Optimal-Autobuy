# CookieClicker-Optimal-Autobuy

Following Repository contains the JS code for a web script which can be applied to the Cookie Clicker web game by using the TamperMonkey web extension.

## To do list:

- Optimise process currently a little slow

- Stop from repeating when there isnt enough money to upgrade, currently the process repeats regardless of whether an upgrade was clicked or not. Wastes computational power

- Buggy when interacting with the site whilst script is running

## Notes For Future Adjustments

- <bold><strong>Issue with big number multiplation, leaving a small decimal at the end. Must be fixed before calculation begins</strong></bold>

- The switch case applied to adjusting the prices in only up to quadrillions unit. Should be implemented better for further progression

- First version only considers available items, should implement functionality to also calculate with the next item to be unlocked

- Could add functionality to include efficiency brought by store upgrades but requires much more functionality

- Could make into an extension, or add a gui allowing users to stop / edit the process

## Script Functionality

- v1.0.0 - Continously checks for most cost effective upgrade and automatically buys the building - 17/06/2024
