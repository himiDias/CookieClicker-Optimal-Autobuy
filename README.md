# CookieClicker-Optimal-Autobuy

Following Repository contains the JS code for a web script which can be applied to the Cookie Clicker web game by using the TamperMonkey web extension.

## Notes For Future Adjustments

- <bold><strong>Unable to get the cookies for each building, ends up only retrieving cookies for time machine 12 times because the tooltip is constantly set to time machine when in a for loop. Must be fixed immediately as cannot move forward</strong><bold>

- <bold><strong>Issue with big number multiplation, leaving a small decimal at the end. Must be fixed before calculation begins</strong></bold>

- The switch case applied to adjusting the prices in only up to quadrillions unit. Should be implemented better for further progression

- First version only considers available items, should implement functionality to also calculate with the next item to be unlocked

- Could add functionality to include efficiency brought by store upgrades but requires much more functionality
